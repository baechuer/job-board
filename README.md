Recommend to use Docker to run the project. However, you will need to set up your mail username and password by setting the environment variable on Dockerfile.
Example of using GMAIL:
    - MAIL_USERNAME=<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>
    - MAIL_PASSWORD=<YOUR APP PASSWORD FOR YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT>

If you are using run.py you will need to manually set all the environment variable.
